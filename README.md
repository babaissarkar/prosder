# Prosder
A simple procedural (command based) graphics system.


# How to use?
## Dependencies
You'll require the _Cairo 2d graphics_ library. If you want to build this from source, you will require the development headers too.  
The cairo runtime library is probably already installed in your linux system. If not, run `sudo apt install libcairo2`. For the development headers, type `sudo apt install libcairo2-dev` (These installation instructions are for Ubuntu. Other Linux distro have their own, usually different commands.)

## Building from source
Simple, just clone this repository, open a terminal where the `Makefile` resides, and run `make`.

## Running
Easy too! Just open a terminal where the `prosder` executable is generated, and run `./prosder`.
